## Exercise 1  

An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a drug treatment for tapeworm in the stomachs of sheep. A random sample of 24 worm-infected lambs of approximately the same age was randomly divided into two groups. Twelve of the lambs were injected with the drug and the remaining twelve were left untreated. After a 6-month period the lambs were slaughtered and the worm counts recorded.

### Part 1a

Load the dataset WormSheep from the DS705data package. Note that the package is loaded above at line 18.  You just need the data() command.  To see all the data sets in the package, type data(package='DS705data').

### -|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|- Answer 1a -|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-

```{r}
  #load in the WormSheep dataset from the DS705data package
data("WormSheep")
```

---

### Part 1b	

Create boxplot, histograms, and normal probability plots for each group (treated vs. untreated).  Be sure that each plot is labeled appropriately.

### -|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|- Answer 1b -|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-

```{r}
  #create a boxplot of worms by treatment type.
boxplot(worms~treated, data = WormSheep, main = "Distribution of Worms in Treated vs. Untreated Sheep", xlab = '', ylab = "Number of Worms")

  #pull the appropiate data into their own vectors - treated vs. untreated
treated = WormSheep[WormSheep$treated == "treated",1]
untreated = WormSheep[WormSheep$treated == "untreated",1]

  #create histograms of the treated and untreated sheep
hist(treated, main = "Distribution of Worms in Treated Sheep", xlab = "Number of Worms")
hist(untreated, main = "Distribution of Worms in Untreated Sheep", xlab = "Number of Worms")

  #create QQ plots to access normality in the samples
qqnorm(treated, main = "Normal Q-Q Plot for Treated Sheep")
qqline(treated)
qqnorm(untreated, main = "Normal Q-Q Plot for Untreated Sheep")
qqline(untreated)

```

### Part 1c  

Do the boxplots show any outliers? 

### -|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|- Answer 1c -|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-

In reviewing the boxplots, there do not appear to be any outliers in either samples. 

---

### Part 1d  

Describe the shapes of the histograms for the sample data for each sample.

### -|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|- Answer 1d -|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-

The treated sheep sample appears to be bivariate, with two bumps on either end of the sample There does not appear to be any skew to the data.

The untreated sheep sample appears to have a heavy number of observations on the left hand side of the sample, and the data appears to be skewed to the right. 

---

### Part 1e  

Do either of the normal probability plots show evidence of non-normality?  Explain.

### -|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|- Answer 1d -|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-

The observations in both samples generally follow the theoritical normal distribution. There's slight indication of right-skew in the untreated group (there are a few observations hovering above the line in the lower tail). But it's fair to say they do not show evidence of non-normality.

### Part 1f 

Conduct an appropriate test to determine if the worm counts in each population can be considered as normally distributed.  Provide the p-value and the conclusion of the test at a 5% level of significance.

### -|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|- Answer 1f -|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-

```{r}
  #using the shapiro test to test the normality of the sample for treated sheep.
shapiro.test(treated)
  #using the shapiro test to test the normality of the sample for untreated sheep.
shapiro.test(untreated)
```
At a 95% significance level, there is not enough evidence to reject that the sample of "treated" sheep from the WormSheep dataset is normally distributed (p-value=0.6504).

At a 95% significance level, there is not enough evidence to reject that the sample of "untreated" sheep from the WormSheep dataset is normally distributed (p-value=0.5491).

### Part 1g	
    
Conduct the test of your choice to determine if the population mean worm count for all sheep treated with the drug is less than the mean worm count for the population of untreated sheep.  Let $\alpha = 0.05$.

#### Step 1

State the null and alternative hypotheses for the test.  If you use symbols, please define them.
 
#### -|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|- Answer 1g.step1 -|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
$$ \mu1 \ = Population\ mean\ of\ treated\ sheep.\\
 \mu2 \ = Population\ mean\ of\ untreated\ sheep.\\
H_0: \mu_\mbox{1} \ >= \mu_\mbox{2}\\
H_a: \mu_\mbox{1} \ < \mu_\mbox{2}$$





#### Step 2

Use R to generate the output for the test you selected.

## Problem 2

Consider two independent, random samples of delay times (in hour) for two airlines over the past 10 years.
